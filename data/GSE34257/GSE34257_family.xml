    <Description>
HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChip allows researchers to interrogate 27,578 highly informative CpG sites per sample at single-nucleotide resolution. This 12-sample BeadChip features content derived from the well-annotated NCBI CCDS database (Genome Build 36) and is supplemented with more than 1,000 cancer-related genes described in published literature. Probe content has been enriched to deeply cover more than 150 well-established cancer genes known to show differential methylation patterns. HumanMethylation27 BeadChip content also targets the promoter regions of 110 miRNA genes.

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

Consenting, non-pregnant women aged 17-45 resident in West Kiang, Gambia were randomised to receive daily supplementation with either UNIMMAP [daily dose; Vitamin A (800 RE), Vitamin D (200 IU), Vitamin E (10 mg), Vitamin C (70 mg),Vitamin B1(1.4 mg), Vitamin B2 (1.4 mg), Niacin (18 mg), Vitamin B6 (1.9 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.6 mg), Folic acid (400 μg), Iron (30 mg), Zinc (15 mg), Copper (2 mg), Selenium (65 μg) and Iodine (150 μg)] or placebo.  Once pregnancy was confirmed by positive pregnancy test at mean gestational age 9.5 weeks women ceased supplementation, and all women received a standard antenatal preparation of iron (60 mg) and folate (250 μg).  Women were excluded from this analysis if they were enrolled for less than 14 days before last menstrual period, or if they apparently consumed less than 70% of allocated tablets.  The trial was approved by the MRC / Gambian Government Ethics Committee, and the current study was also approved by the MRC Laboratories Fajara Scientific Co-ordinating Committee (L2007.77, 21/9/07) and the Gambian Government Ethics Committee (25/10/07).

    <Title>The effect of periconceptional micronutrient supplementation on offspring DNA methylation</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE34257</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>22307237</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The effect of pre and periconceptional multiple micronutrient supplementation on methylation of CpG loci within CpG islands associated with 14,000 genes across the human genome has been investigated in the offspring of a cohort of Gambian women participating in a controlled double blinded trial. Methylation levels in placebo and micronutrient supplemented cohorts were compared in genomic DNA from cord blood (35 placebo and 21 micronutrient supplemented) and in circulating blood samples (14 placebo and 9 micronutrient supplemented) drawn from the same cohort at 9 months old. A small number of differentially methylated CpG loci were identified in cord blood (14 in males and 21 in females) and a larger number in the 9 month infant comparison (108 in males and 106 in females). Seven differentially methylated loci in males and 8 in females persisted from cord to infant. These findings indicate that micronutrient supplementation pre-conception or early in embryonic development is potentially associated with programming of gene activity at birth, which is maintained into early infanthood. Strikingly, the loci affected by micronutrient supplementation differed between males and females, with no shared changes in cord blood and only 5 shared changes at 9 months. Additionally, a large number of CpG loci showed variation in methylation level when comparing 9-month samples to cord blood samples. These postnatal changes were more consistent between sexes, with 85% of female alterations being found as a subset of male changes in the placebo cohort and 62% of the female changes shared with males in the supplemented cohort. Taken together, the results suggest that there is a core developmental program shared between the sexes that is unaffected by nutrient supplementation, but that there are also sex-specific developmental changes which are altered under conditions of micronutrient supplementation and deficiency.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Bisulphite converted DNA from 59 cord (36 placebo and 23 treated) and 25 infant peripheral blood (15 placebo and 10 treated) samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2.  (For further analysis, five were excluded during quality control leaving 56 cord (35 placebo and 21 treated) and 23 infant peripheral blood (14 placebo and 9 treated) samples. Full data set of 84 samples were submitted to GEO)
